        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration Management</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a 20 year old college student, I have already gained quite a bit of experience under my belt, that would be beneficial to the business world. For starters, at 16 I began my first retail job at Banana Republic as a Brand Ambassador. Customer service/relations has always been not a problem for me, as I have a charismatic and friendly character. My experience at Banana Republic at such a young age demonstrated the real world to me, and presented real life problems and scenarios that forced me to enable critical thinking and problem solving skills. Although my time there was short, I certainly learned basic customer service skills and communication. 
 <br><br>

        I have always been a friendly person, and I always want to ensure that the people around me receive the best care. In the business world, customer service skills are extremely important, because consumers are the ones that drive businesses forward. Without great communication to clients and customers, the business is destined to fail. Consumers always enjoy when businesses provide excellent services to them, and that cannot be done without exceptional customer service.<br><br>

        At the age of 18, I began perhaps the most life-changing and beneficial experience of my life. At this age I began working at a grocery store called Stater Bros. Although working at a grocery store does not sound in any way phenomenal, I was able to work my way up and earn a respectable title. I began as a bagger and cart pusher, which again, enabled my customer service skills, in regards to communicating with customers on a daily basis. A couple months later I moved up and began working in the Bakery. This experience was completely new to me, but I learned a great set of skills, as I had to learn how to work with food. It was a strenuous position, but I learned a great deal about food safety, product production and inventory, as well as continuing customer service engagement. A few months after that I moved up to cashier, this was especially important for me, as I had to learn how to accept a multitude of universal payments, as well as technological skills. Being a cashier was perhaps my most favorite position, as I loved multitasking, as well as problem solving, and customer engagement. My final position in the company was a floor supervisor. Not only was I in charge of everything that was previously stated in the paragraph, but I also was in charge of all the front end employees. At times it became pretty overwhelming, but it definitely strengthened my critical thinking skills, and trained me to continue to provide exceptional customer service.
